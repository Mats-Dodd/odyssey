# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Bootstrap Service for Local PGLite Data Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a bootstrap service that synchronizes user data from Supabase to the local PGLite database after successful authentication, handling data versioning, conflict resolution, and providing appropriate loading states.
# Details:
The bootstrap service will be responsible for synchronizing user data between Supabase and the local PGLite database. Implementation steps include:

1. Create a new `@typyst/sync` package with the following structure:
   - `src/bootstrap.ts` - Main bootstrap service implementation
   - `src/stores.ts` - Svelte stores for sync state management
   - `src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for sync operations
   - `src/utils/` - Helper utilities for versioning and conflict resolution

2. Implement the bootstrap service with the following features:
   - Hook into authentication events to trigger sync after successful login
   - Fetch user collections and entries from Supabase using authenticated API routes
   - Implement data versioning with timestamps for each record
   - Create conflict resolution strategies (server-wins, client-wins, manual merge)
   - Populate the local PGLite database with fetched data
   - Provide Svelte stores for sync state (idle, syncing, error)

3. Implement data cleanup on sign out:
   - Clear all user-specific data from PGLite when user signs out
   - Reset sync state stores to initial values
   - Implement proper error handling for failed cleanup

4. Create loading indicators and error handling:
   - Develop UI components for displaying sync status
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed sync operations
   - Create error boundaries for sync failures
   - Log detailed error information for debugging

5. Optimize performance:
   - Implement incremental sync for large datasets
   - Use batch operations for database writes
   - Add support for background sync with Web Workers
   - Implement throttling for API requests

6. Add configuration options:
   - Allow customization of sync frequency
   - Configure conflict resolution strategies
   - Set up data retention policies
   - Enable/disable automatic sync on authentication

7. Document the bootstrap service API and usage patterns for other developers.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Write unit tests for each core function in the bootstrap service
   - Test versioning logic with various timestamp scenarios
   - Verify conflict resolution strategies work as expected
   - Test data transformation functions between Supabase and PGLite formats
   - Mock authentication events to test sync triggering

2. Integration Tests:
   - Set up a test environment with Supabase and PGLite
   - Test the complete sync flow from authentication to data population
   - Verify data integrity between Supabase and local PGLite
   - Test sign out data cleanup functionality
   - Simulate network failures and verify retry mechanisms

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create E2E tests that simulate user login and verify data availability
   - Test the application with various network conditions
   - Verify UI loading states appear correctly during sync
   - Test error handling and user feedback for sync failures

4. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark sync performance with various dataset sizes
   - Test incremental sync efficiency
   - Measure memory usage during sync operations
   - Verify application responsiveness during sync

5. Manual Testing:
   - Perform sign in/sign out cycles and verify data consistency
   - Test offline capabilities after initial sync
   - Verify data changes propagate correctly between devices
   - Test conflict scenarios with simultaneous edits

6. Acceptance Criteria Verification:
   - Verify sync triggers automatically after authentication
   - Confirm all user data is correctly populated in PGLite
   - Check that versioning and conflict resolution work as expected
   - Validate loading states and error handling during bootstrap
   - Confirm local data is properly cleared on sign out
