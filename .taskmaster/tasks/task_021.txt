# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Storage Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize local storage operations for improved performance.
# Details:
1. Optimize local database operations to be under 50ms
2. Improve filesystem operations to be under 100ms
3. Implement efficient incremental updates
4. Optimize storage space usage
5. Implement lazy loading for large datasets
6. Use efficient indexing for faster data retrieval
7. Implement batch operations for multiple data updates

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark local database operation times
2. Measure filesystem operation performance
3. Test efficiency of incremental updates
4. Monitor storage space usage over time
5. Verify performance improvement with lazy loading
6. Test query performance with indexes
7. Measure performance of batch operations
