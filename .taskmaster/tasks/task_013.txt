# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize sync and data management operations for improved performance.
# Details:
1. Implement debounced local updates to reduce sync frequency
2. Optimize serialization of Loro documents
3. Develop efficient memory management for large collections
4. Implement background sync without blocking UI
5. Create selective sync mechanism for large datasets
6. Use Web Workers for computationally intensive tasks
7. Implement proper indexing for database queries

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure sync frequency with debounced updates
2. Benchmark serialization performance
3. Test memory usage with large collections
4. Verify UI responsiveness during background sync
5. Test selective sync with various dataset sizes
6. Measure performance improvement with Web Workers
7. Benchmark query performance with indexes
