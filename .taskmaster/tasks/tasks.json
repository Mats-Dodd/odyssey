Set up redirect logic for unauthenticated users.\n<info added on 2025-06-15T20:15:39.147Z>\n✅ **Auth Routes Created:**\n- `/auth/sign-in` - Sign in page with email/password form, validation, and redirect handling\n- `/auth/sign-up` - Sign up page with email/password/confirm password, validation, and redirect handling  \n- `/auth/sign-out` - Automatic sign out page that signs user out and redirects\n\n✅ **Route Protection Implemented:**\n- Created `hooks.server.ts` with authentication middleware\n- Protected routes: `/notes`, `/tasks`, `/daily` - redirect to sign-in if not authenticated\n- Auth routes redirect authenticated users away (to prevent double sign-in)\n- Proper redirect handling with `redirectTo` query parameter\n\n✅ **Session Management:**\n- Updated `app.d.ts` with proper session types in App.Locals\n- Modified `+layout.server.ts` to pass session data from server to client\n- Updated main layout to initialize auth state with server session data\n- Added auth state synchronization between server and client\n\n✅ **UI Integration:**\n- Updated header component to show auth status\n- Shows \"Welcome, [name]\" and \"Sign Out\" button when authenticated\n- Shows \"Sign In\" and \"Sign Up\" buttons when not authenticated\n- Proper reactive auth state management using Svelte stores\n\n✅ **Error Handling:**\n- Form validation on auth pages\n- Error display for auth failures\n- Graceful fallback for session initialization errors\n\nThe auth routes and protection system is now fully functional and integrated with the existing UI.\n</info added on 2025-06-15T20:15:39.147Z>",

        "description": "Develop a bootstrap service that synchronizes user data from Supabase to the local PGLite database after successful authentication, handling data versioning, conflict resolution, and providing appropriate loading states.",
        "details": "The bootstrap service will be responsible for synchronizing user data between Supabase and the local PGLite database. Implementation steps include:\n\n1. Create a new `@typyst/sync` package with the following structure:\n   - `src/bootstrap.ts` - Main bootstrap service implementation\n   - `src/stores.ts` - Svelte stores for sync state management\n   - `src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for sync operations\n   - `src/utils/` - Helper utilities for versioning and conflict resolution\n\n2. Implement the bootstrap service with the following features:\n   - Hook into authentication events to trigger sync after successful login\n   - Fetch user collections and entries from Supabase using authenticated API routes\n   - Implement data versioning with timestamps for each record\n   - Create conflict resolution strategies (server-wins, client-wins, manual merge)\n   - Populate the local PGLite database with fetched data\n   - Provide Svelte stores for sync state (idle, syncing, error)\n\n3. Implement data cleanup on sign out:\n   - Clear all user-specific data from PGLite when user signs out\n   - Reset sync state stores to initial values\n   - Implement proper error handling for failed cleanup\n\n4. Create loading indicators and error handling:\n   - Develop UI components for displaying sync status\n   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed sync operations\n   - Create error boundaries for sync failures\n   - Log detailed error information for debugging\n\n5. Optimize performance:\n   - Implement incremental sync for large datasets\n   - Use batch operations for database writes\n   - Add support for background sync with Web Workers\n   - Implement throttling for API requests\n\n6. Add configuration options:\n   - Allow customization of sync frequency\n   - Configure conflict resolution strategies\n   - Set up data retention policies\n   - Enable/disable automatic sync on authentication\n\n7. Document the bootstrap service API and usage patterns for other developers.",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit Tests:\n   - Write unit tests for each core function in the bootstrap service\n   - Test versioning logic with various timestamp scenarios\n   - Verify conflict resolution strategies work as expected\n   - Test data transformation functions between Supabase and PGLite formats\n   - Mock authentication events to test sync triggering\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Set up a test environment with Supabase and PGLite\n   - Test the complete sync flow from authentication to data population\n   - Verify data integrity between Supabase and local PGLite\n   - Test sign out data cleanup functionality\n   - Simulate network failures and verify retry mechanisms\n\n3. End-to-End Tests:\n   - Create E2E tests that simulate user login and verify data availability\n   - Test the application with various network conditions\n   - Verify UI loading states appear correctly during sync\n   - Test error handling and user feedback for sync failures\n\n4. Performance Testing:\n   - Benchmark sync performance with various dataset sizes\n   - Test incremental sync efficiency\n   - Measure memory usage during sync operations\n   - Verify application responsiveness during sync\n\n5. Manual Testing:\n   - Perform sign in/sign out cycles and verify data consistency\n   - Test offline capabilities after initial sync\n   - Verify data changes propagate correctly between devices\n   - Test conflict scenarios with simultaneous edits\n\n6. Acceptance Criteria Verification:\n   - Verify sync triggers automatically after authentication\n   - Confirm all user data is correctly populated in PGLite\n   - Check that versioning and conflict resolution work as expected\n   - Validate loading states and error handling during bootstrap\n   - Confirm local data is properly cleared on sign out",
