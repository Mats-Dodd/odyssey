# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Cross-Platform Sync Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement sync logic for seamless data synchronization between desktop and web platforms.
# Details:
1. Implement desktop filesystem to Loro state synchronization
2. Develop web PGLite to Loro state synchronization
3. Create automatic merge conflict resolution logic
4. Implement incremental updates for efficient data transfer
5. Develop network failure handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Implement selective sync for large datasets
7. Use TypeScript for type-safe implementation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test sync between desktop filesystem and Loro state
2. Verify sync between web PGLite and Loro state
3. Simulate and test merge conflicts
4. Measure performance of incremental updates
5. Test network failure scenarios and recovery
6. Verify selective sync functionality for large datasets
