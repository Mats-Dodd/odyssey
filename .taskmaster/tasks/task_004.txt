# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Authentication Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the complete authentication flow including sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality, and integrate the @typyst/auth package with the SvelteKit web application.
# Details:
1. Integrate @typyst/auth package with SvelteKit web app
2. Configure environment variables and database connection for auth
3. Set up auth routes and protected pages
4. Implement user sign up with email/password using Better Auth
5. Develop sign in functionality with session creation
6. Implement session persistence using HTTP-only cookies
7. Create session validation and refresh logic
8. Develop sign out functionality with local data cleanup
9. Implement error handling for auth operations
10. Create loading states for auth processes
11. Use Svelte stores for reactive auth state management in the UI

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify @typyst/auth package integration with SvelteKit
2. Test database connection and auth configuration
3. Validate protected routes functionality
4. Test user sign up with valid and invalid inputs
5. Verify sign in functionality and session creation
6. Test session persistence across page reloads
7. Validate session refresh mechanism
8. Test sign out and local data cleanup
9. Simulate and test error scenarios
10. Verify loading states during auth operations
11. Test reactive auth state management in the UI

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate @typyst/auth with SvelteKit for web app [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure seamless integration of the @typyst/auth package with SvelteKit for the web application.

Configure environment variables and auth configuration management for the web environment, implement proper error handling and validation throughout the auth flow, and ensure compatibility with SvelteKit's routing and SSR capabilities.

## 2. Set up auth routes and protected pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create the necessary routes for authentication and implement protection for pages that require authentication.
### Details:
Implement route handlers for sign up, sign in, and sign out. Create middleware or hooks to protect routes that require authentication. Set up redirect logic for unauthenticated users.

## 3. Create UI components for authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the user interface components needed for the authentication flow.
### Details:
Create sign up form, sign in form, and sign out button components. Implement form validation, error display, and loading indicators. Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance.

## 4. Implement reactive auth state management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create a reactive auth state management system using Svelte stores.
### Details:
Implement Svelte stores to track authentication state. Create derived stores for user data, loading states, and error messages. Ensure proper reactivity throughout the application when auth state changes.
