# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Sync Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize sync operations for improved performance and resource usage.
# Details:
1. Optimize real-time sync latency to be under 3 seconds
2. Improve conflict resolution to be under 1 second
3. Optimize large collection sync to be under 30 seconds
4. Implement memory usage optimizations to stay under 100MB for typical workloads
5. Use WebWorkers for computationally intensive sync operations
6. Implement efficient data compression for sync payloads
7. Optimize Loro CRDT operations for large datasets

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure sync latency for various data sizes
2. Benchmark conflict resolution times
3. Test sync performance with large collections
4. Monitor memory usage during sync operations
5. Measure performance improvement with WebWorkers
6. Test sync efficiency with compressed payloads
7. Benchmark Loro CRDT operations on large datasets
