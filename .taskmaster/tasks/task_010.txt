# Task ID: 10
# Title: Design Sync Manager Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a real-time sync manager with device identification and efficient sync operations.
# Details:
1. Implement a real-time sync manager with unique device identification
2. Develop polling-based sync with 2-second intervals
3. Create local update handling and queuing mechanism
4. Implement push/pull operations with Supabase API
5. Develop exponential backoff for failed sync attempts
6. Implement efficient serialization of Loro documents
7. Create background sync functionality without blocking UI

# Test Strategy:
1. Test device identification mechanism
2. Verify polling intervals and behavior
3. Test local update queuing and processing
4. Simulate and test push/pull operations
5. Verify exponential backoff functionality
6. Measure serialization performance
7. Test background sync operations
