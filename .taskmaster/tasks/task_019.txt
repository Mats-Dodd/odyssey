# Task ID: 19
# Title: Optimize Authentication Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations for authentication and bootstrap processes.
# Details:
1. Optimize sign in/up response time to be under 2 seconds
2. Improve bootstrap completion to be under 10 seconds for typical datasets
3. Optimize local session validation to be under 100ms
4. Implement efficient offline-to-online transition
5. Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed auth data
6. Implement lazy loading for non-critical auth components
7. Optimize database queries for auth operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark sign in/up response times
2. Measure bootstrap completion time for various dataset sizes
3. Test local session validation performance
4. Verify smooth offline-to-online transitions
5. Measure impact of caching on auth performance
6. Test loading times with lazy-loaded components
7. Benchmark database query performance
