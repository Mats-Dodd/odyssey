4. Test Svelte stores reactivity
5. Verify SvelteKit integration in both SSR and CSR contexts
6. Review documentation for clarity and completeness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up @typyst/auth package structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial package structure for @typyst/auth, including necessary files and configurations.
### Details:
Initialize package.json, set up TypeScript configuration, create src directory structure, add README.md, and configure build scripts. Include Better Auth v1.0.0 as a dependency.

✅ **Package Structure Setup Complete**

Successfully set up the @typyst/auth package structure with:

**Package Configuration:**
- Created `package.json` with Better Auth v1.0.0 dependency
- Configured TypeScript with proper module resolution
- Set up proper exports for client/server separation
- Added nanostores for reactive state management

**File Structure Created:**
- `src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/server.ts` - Server-side authentication with Better Auth
- `src/client.ts` - Client-side auth with nanostores integration
- `src/svelte.ts` - Svelte-specific utilities and stores
- `src/index.ts` - Main export file
- `src/client-entry.ts` - Client-only exports
- `src/server-entry.ts` - Server-only exports
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

**Build System:**
- TypeScript compilation configured and working
- Package builds successfully without errors
- Proper module exports for tree-shaking

The package structure is now ready for the next subtask (server-side authentication implementation).

## 2. Implement server-side authentication with Better Auth [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure Better Auth server for email/password authentication and integrate it into the @typyst/auth package.
### Details:
Use betterAuth() to configure the server, implement email/password authentication flows, set up proper session management with secure cookie handling, and create TypeScript interfaces for auth-related types.
<info added on 2025-06-15T06:06:39.401Z>
Successfully implemented server-side authentication with Better Auth:

**Core Implementation:**
- Created `createAuthServer()` function with comprehensive configuration
- Implemented email/password authentication with Better Auth
- Added proper session management with configurable expiration
- Set up secure cookie handling and session updates

**Authentication Methods:**
- `signUp()` - User registration with email/password
- `signIn()` - User authentication with optional remember me
- `signOut()` - Session termination
- `getSession()` - Session retrieval with proper typing
- `verifySession()` - Session validation utility
- `requireAuth()` - Authentication guard for protected routes

**Configuration Features:**
- Database provider support (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Configurable session expiration and update intervals
- Trusted origins for CORS handling
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all auth types

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks for all auth operations
- Consistent error response format
- Proper error typing and messaging

The server-side authentication is fully functional and ready for integration.

## 3. Develop client-side auth client for Svelte [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create a Svelte-compatible auth client using Better Auth's createAuthClient() and implement Svelte stores for auth state management.
### Details:
Use createAuthClient() to set up the client, implement useSession() hook for Svelte, create Svelte stores for managing auth state, and ensure proper TypeScript typing for the client.

✅ **Client-side Authentication Implementation Complete**

Successfully implemented client-side authentication with Better Auth and Svelte integration:

**Core Client Implementation:**
- Created `createAuthClientInstance()` function with Better Auth's `createAuthClient()`
- Implemented reactive state management using nanostores
- Added automatic session initialization and management
- Set up proper TypeScript typing for all client methods

**Authentication Methods:**
- `signUp()` - User registration with callback support
- `signIn()` - User authentication with callback support  
- `signOut()` - Session termination with callback support
- `getSession()` - Session retrieval
- `refreshSession()` - Manual session refresh

**Reactive Stores (nanostores):**
- `authState` - Complete authentication state
- `user` - Current user data
- `session` - Current session data
- `isAuthenticated` - Boolean authentication status
- `isLoading` - Loading state indicator
- `authError` - Current error state

**Svelte Integration:**
- `createSvelteAuthStores()` - Converts nanostores to Svelte stores
- `requireAuth()` - Svelte action for route protection
- `createSessionGuard()` - Utility for SvelteKit load functions
- Full reactive integration with Svelte's reactivity system

**Features:**
- Automatic session initialization on client-side
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly callbacks
- SSR-safe implementation with proper client-side checks
- Type-safe throughout with full TypeScript support

The client-side authentication is fully functional and ready for integration.

## 4. Create comprehensive documentation and examples [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Develop detailed documentation and usage examples for the @typyst/auth package.
### Details:
Create comprehensive README.md with installation instructions, API documentation, usage examples for both server and client implementations, and SvelteKit integration guides. Include code snippets for common authentication flows.

## 5. Final package review and preparation for integration [completed]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Review the completed @typyst/auth package and prepare it for integration with the database (task 3) and web application (task 4).
### Details:
Perform a final review of the package to ensure all features are working as expected. Verify that the package is ready for integration with the database once task 3 is completed. Document any specific integration points or requirements for the web application integration in task 4.
